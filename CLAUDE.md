# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the content specification and media assets for a landing page for the book "10 000 км до себе" (10,000 km to Myself) — a Ukrainian motivational novel and travelogue.

**Project Structure:**
- Main specification: `Лендинг для Валерки 2cc1abc6131b8055b673fc33811cc619.md` — Contains the complete landing page content structure with all sections, copy, pricing, and calls-to-action
- Media assets: `media/` directory — Contains book photography, author photos, and chapter illustrations in various formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF, SVG)

## Key Content Sections

The landing page specification includes six main sections:

1. **Hero Block** — Main headline, tagline, key quote, and primary CTAs
2. **Pain Identification Block** — "This is about you if..." section targeting the audience
3. **Value Proposition Block** — Explanation of what the book is about
4. **Format Selection Block** — Three product offerings (digital, print, VIP) with pricing and benefits
5. **Emotional Closing Block** — Doubt resolution and final messaging
6. **Footer** — Copyright and branding

## Product Formats

The landing page promotes three formats:

- **Stealth Mode** (EPUB/PDF) — 199–249 UAH — Digital format
- **Exit the Matrix** (Printed Book + Bookmark) — 390–450 UAH — Recommended format with quality print and author bookmark
- **Full Tank** (VIP/Gift Edition) — 650–800 UAH — Premium offering with personalized autograph, stickers, playlist, and postcard

## Development Notes

- This repository currently contains specifications and assets only — no build system, tests, or development commands
- All content is written in Ukrainian
- Media assets are high-resolution (multiple files exceed 100MB) — organize thoughtfully if implementing this as a web project
- When building the actual landing page, prioritize the "Exit the Matrix" format as the recommended option
